📃 INSTRUCTIONS
============
## 🚀Execution
Remote Calculator uses the folowing libraries :
- [Awt](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html)
- [Rmi](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/index.html)
- [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html)
- [Util](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html)

To execute it, compile every file in the server repertory, place the _.class_ files in the client repertory, and compile the _GUI.java_ file in the client side. Finally, run the _ServerCalculation.java_ on the server side, then the _GUI.java_ file on the client side. This is roughly the procedure described by [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/hello/hello-world.html).

As a result, a window pops up on the client side.

## ⚙️Usage
This program supports integer number only. To enter an operation, you can use the buttons or type it. The input must have the template **a␣operator␣b**. If you type it, don't forget the spaces. An invalid form entry will result in an error. Also, an exception is created in case of a division by zero.

Now it is your turn to use it !

Thank you for using Remote calculator 🙂
